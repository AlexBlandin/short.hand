# short.hand
Some short.hand files for various languages that I sometimes use

No promises that these are up-to-date or in anyway complete or representative...

Usually just what I need to get something like [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org) running and I'd rather not use gists because I prefer readable `#includes`
